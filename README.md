## Overview

This repository contains Project 1 of the University of Minnesota Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp. The project's goal was to develop a hypothesis based on public datasets, load the data into pandas DataFrames for analysis and manipulation, and create visualizations using matplotlib to present findings.

Our final presentation, shared with the class, can be viewed in `final_presentation.pdf`.
