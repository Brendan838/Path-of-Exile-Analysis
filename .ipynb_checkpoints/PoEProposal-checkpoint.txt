Path of Exile Economic Analysis Proposal

Hello!

This is a proposal for a new data analysis project concerning economic data pulled from a video game called Path of Exile. 

Our Project Team Members are:
Sam C
Lance P
Jacob F
Dylan M
and Brendan S

Project Scope and Objectives.
-----------------------------

    As stated above, the focus of this project is on a video game called Path of Exile. Every few months brings a new batch of content, called "Leagues." Every league is a fresh start, meaning players start over again with none of their accumulated gear and items. The game features a system where players can trade with other players, using items found in the game as a "Currency". Most typically do this using a trade website the developers created specifically for player trading. There is a 3rd party website called "poe.ninja" that pulls data from an API created by the game developers and shows an immense amount of economic info. This includes things like the # of listings an item currently has, the most common asking price for an item, a trend line showing price changes over time, and much more.

We think this is a super interesting starting point for a deeper analysis. Some things we want to look at are:

- The price trend for the universal trading currencies used: Chaos Orbs and Divine Orbs.
    - As a comparison point, you can thing of each Chaos Orb as 1 US Dollar and 1 Divine Orb as 100 US Dollars
- What kinds of things are in high demand, when they are in demand, and if we can determine a strategy to take advantage of said trends for future releases of the game.
- If a certain item or set of items is consistent in demand across multiple leagues, can we determine why that is so we can create a game plan to get a head start on trading trends for the next upcoming league.

Data Sources and Collection Methods.
------------------------------------

    The largest source of data we'll be using is pulled and provided directly from poe.ninja. The website has a page where they store economic data from previous leagues in convenient csv files. This mostly shows snapshots of prices for every individual tracked item and how the price changes every day. We will also be pulling info from the website "Steam Charts" and the associating API it uses to gather info about how many people are playing the game at any given time, which may help inform some trend analyses.

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
-------------------------
    Tasks for each member are still being solidified, but Lance is handling Steam Charts/Steam API, Jacob is focusing on presentation material/analyses, and data analysis programming in general is being looked into by Brendan/Sam/Dylan. Again, roles are still being solidified but that is our current overview.
